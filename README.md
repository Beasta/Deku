# Deku

Deku is a social network and climate monitoring tool for gardening and greenhouse enthusiasts. Users have customizable profiles where they can post updates and see a news feed of updates of users they are following. Users can make tags for plants they are growing or technologies/methods they are using to do so. The tags can then be used to easily find other users with similar interests. A forum is also available for communal conversations.

The final piece of Deku is climate monitoring. A pathway is provided for users to set up a [Tessel microcontroller](https://tessel.io). When equipped with the proper sensors, the Tessel can stream data on temperature, humidity, and light conditions straight to a user's Deku profile.
